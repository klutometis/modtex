                          ABSTRACT

          "Neotera" were to the Athenians no good news;
     here, however, are  our  more  visible  mutations:
     violent, we hope, and benign.

          We  decided,  again,  to  support  XyMTeX  as  the
          default chemical interpreter.

          I considered looking into a SMILES/InChi-to-graph-
          ics pathway; but BKChem, the only interpreter that
          seems to do batch processing,  requires  a  frame-
          buffer.

          Also,  an  interesting  discussion at WikiProject-
          Chemistry:[1]

               [SMILES  is]  okay  for simple stuff, but for
               anything more complicated, it  becomes  irri-
               tating  to not be able to define the orienta-
               tion that you actually want in  the  diagram.
               For some things, it's impossible: try getting
               any app to draw a  metallocene  legibly  from
               SMILES :-)

          The question is, therefore, XyMTeX vs. PPCHTeX:[2]

               The  [downside]  of [PPCHTeX] is that it han-
               dles anything other than plane structures  of
               five- and sixrings very badly.
               --Sverdrup 10:28, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

          A  compromise?   XyMTeX  by default, possibly, and
          some flag or non-standard tag to expose PPCHTeX.

          Added support  for  FeynMF  today  (<feyn></feyn);
          recently gnuplot and LilyPond made the cut.

          During  this  phase  we also spun-off mod_tex as a
          separate entity, and WikiTeX as an  ad-hoc  Media-
          Wiki client that connects thither.

          Near  term:  finish  off  remaining  classes (cir-
          cuits?); may verzichten upon Greek  and  Tipa,  or
          give them unicode backends.
