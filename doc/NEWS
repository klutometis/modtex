                          ABSTRACT

          "Neotera" were to the Athenians no good news;
     here, however, are  our  more  visible  mutations:
     violent, we hope, and benign.

          Added  support  for  FeynMF  today (<feyn></feyn);
          recently gnuplot and LilyPond made the cut.

          During this phase we also spun-off  mod_tex  as  a
          separate  entity,  and WikiTeX as an ad-hoc Media-
          Wiki client that connects thither.

          Near term:  finish  off  remaining  classes  (cir-
          cuits?);  may  verzichten  upon Greek and Tipa, or
          give them unicode backends.

          This document was prepared in GNU troff using  the
     ms macro package; preprocessed with tbl, the table for-
     matter; and  lastly  filtered  through  col  to  remove
     reverse line feeds and tabs:

          groff -ms -t -Tascii SOURCE | col -bx > OUT

     Automatically  generated  contents were moved from page
     last to first with an ad-hoc bash-diddy.
