0.  Prerequisites

     0.1.  Server

          o    Apache

          o    mod_python

          o    teTeX and dvipng (or TeX Live)

          o    Python 2.5[1]

1.  Installation


     1.1.  Server

          1.   Copy src/server/modtex/config/default.py to:

                    src/server/modtex/config/local.py

          2.   Edit local.py to satisfaction.[2]

          3.   Run:

                    python setup.py build

               and:

                    sudo python setup.py install

          4.   (Optional) Mount /usr/local/var/modtex on its
               own partition with NOSUID.

          5.   Set    up    a    chroot    environment    in
               /usr/local/var/modtex/latex  for  teTeX   and
               dvipng.[3]

          6.   Within the chroot, edit texmf.cnf to read:

-----------
  1. We  take  advantage  of with-statements which
will become native in 2.6.
  2. See section 3, Configuration.
  3. See section 4, Chroot.

                    shell_escape = f
                    openout_any = p
                    openin_any = p

          7.   ???

          8.   Profit!

     1.2.  Handler

               The   Apache-handler   mediates  between  the
          client   and   chrooted   daemons;   it   requires
          mod_python.

          1.   Install mod_python,[4] if necessary.

          2.   You  may need to edit the .htaccess which was
               installed, by default, in:

                    /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/modtex/.htaccess

2.  Execution

          `modtex'   and  `modtex-debug'  are  installed  by
     default in /usr/local/bin.  They both take `start'  and
     `stop'  as  arguments, but `modtex-debug' provides some
     additional output to the  syslog  and  keeps  all  work
     directories  intact  in /usr/local/var/modtex/latex/tmp
     for inspection.

          `modtex-debug' also refrains from setting resource
     limits,  since  setting  resource  limits can introduce
     anti-intuitive errors and must be done with care.

          `modtex', on the other hand, cleans up work direc-
     tories (except in cases of resource-faults); and prints
     minimally to syslog.

          `modtex' and `modtex-debug' need to be run as root
     to  chroot  into  the  rendering  environment, but drop
     privileges immediately to modtex:modtex.

3.  Configuration

     3.1.  Directories

               mod_tex allows relatively fine-tuned  control
          over  the install-location, and provides some rea-
          sonable defaults.

     3.2.  Users

               mod_tex also allows the  ability  to  specify
          the  nonprivileged user to whom it will drop after
          detaching from the console; it should be  distinct
          from the Apache user, and ideally ad-hoc.

     3.3.  Facilities

               Please inspect the facilities section to make
          sure that they correspond to your chroot  environ-
          ment;  in  particular,  you  will  need to specify
          absolute paths to binaries.

     3.4.  Resources

               mod_tex's resource managament has three  lay-
          ers: internal, kernel-enforced and per-user.

          3.4.1.  Internal

                    The  `default_wait'  dictionary provides
               fine-grained control  over  signals  sent  to
               runaway  processes; `default_wait' works over
               and above RLIMIT_CPU, whose  effects  can  be
               hard to predict.

          3.4.2.  Kernel-Enforced

                    Read  more  about  kernel-limits in `man
               setrlimit'; mod_tex includes fairly Draconian
               policies  which  may  need  to be relaxed for
               production-sites.

          3.4.3.  Per-User

                    `ctime_unit'  and   `max_ctime_per_unit'
               provide  ways  to  limit  resource-usage from
               particular  users.   mod_tex  calculates  how
               much  CPU-time  a user has usurped within one
               `ctime_unit';   if    its    usage    exceeds
               `max_ctime_per_unit'  with that unit of time,
               the request is temporarily denied.

                    The upshot is that  users  may  have  to
               submit several requests to complete a partic-
               ularly time-consuming document.

4.  Chroot

          Chrooting is art and science; and can be risky if,
     for instance, you leave suid-binaries lying around.





                       31 January 2007





README                       -4-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


          Rebuild ld.so.cache within the jail after changing
     libs.

          That said, Jailkit[5] and Makejail[6]  are  useful
     utilities.

     4.1.  LaTeX

               TeX   Live[7]  provides  a  statically-linked
          dvipng in its full installation, and significantly
          reduces the library-overhead.

               When running `install-tl.sh', supply the fol-
          lowing (or similar) for TEXDIR:

               /usr/local/var/modtex/latex/usr/local/texlive

               The latex-facility in local.py may need to be
          adjusted accordingly; for instance:

               /usr/local/texlive/bin/i386-linux/latex

          in lieu of /usr/local/teTeX/bin/latex.

     4.2.  Graphviz

               Using  Jailkit,  and  after  compiling  GTK+,
          GLib,  Pango,  Cairo, Fontconfig and Graphviz with
          `--enable-static',[8] the following  sufficed  for
          our entry in `jk_init.ini':

               [dot]
               executables = /usr/local/bin/dot
               directories = /lib, /usr/local/etc/pango, /usr/local/etc/fonts
               directories = /usr/share/fonts, /usr/share/X11/fonts, /usr/local/lib/pango
               regularfiles = /etc/ld.so.conf, /etc/ld.so.cache, /etc/passwd, /etc/group
               regularfiles = /usr/local/bin/circo, /usr/local/bin/neato, /usr/local/bin/fdp
               regularfiles = /usr/local/bin/twopi

               In  our experience, the cachedir for fontcon-
          fig should be changed[9] from:

               NONE/var/cache/fontconfig

  6. http://www.floc.net/makejail
  7. http://www.tug.org/texlive
  8. To make life easier, Graphviz was  configured
with  `--disable-swig'; also, `/usr/local/bin/dot'
must be manually linked to `dot_static'.
  9. See /usr/local/etc/fonts/fonts.conf  relative
to the root.

README                       -5-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


          to:

               /var/cache/fontconfig

          or else fontconfig will populate a local cache dir
          with each render, which is time consuming.

               Next, either /var/cache/fontconfig should  be
          rendered  writable  to  modtex:modtex; or, prefer-
          ably, graphviz run as root from within the jail to
          populate the cachedir.

5.  Architecture

          In  short, an XML-RPC client (e.g., the MediaWiki-
     client) connects to the  mod_python  frontend  ("Trader
     Joe") served by Apache.

          Trader  Joe,  in  turn,  connects  to  autonomous,
     unprivileged, chrooted  daemons  sitting  on  arbitrary
     machines, that actually render the content.

          After authentication,[10] but  before  Trader  Joe
     befrays the rendering drones, he checks an IP->CPU-time
     database to see whether the client has  used  up  their
     allotted rendering time.

                                              LaTeX-daemon
                                             /
     client<--(auth)-->traderjoe<--(resource)-->LilyPond-daemon
                                             \
                                              ...-daemon


          The daemons should not be accessible to the intar-
     web at large.

7.  Colophon

          This document was prepared in GNU troff using  the
     ms macro package; preprocessed with tbl, the table for-
     matter; and  lastly  filtered  through  col  to  remove
     reverse line feeds and tabs:

          groff -ms -t -Tascii SOURCE | col -bx > OUT

     Automatically  generated  contents were moved from page
     last to first with an ad-hoc bash-diddy.
