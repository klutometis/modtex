1.  Exigenda

     1.1.  Server

          Parse-trees
               Bring back parse-trees, since Graphviz is not
               a drop-in replacement.

          Back-end
               Transition  to  an array of chrooted Apaches;
               dump SimpleXMLRPCServer on the back-end.

          Error-messages
               Facilities-flag in default.py to return  out-
               put  from  a process, giving feedback; useful
               for: LaTeX or LilyPond, for instance, to dis-
               close syntax errors.

               Not so useful for dvipng, etc. (sysadmins can
               retrieve that from the syslog).

               Some way to scrub sensitive data like  paths?
               The chroot path-structure is well documented,
               though.

          File-size
               Limit requests to size X to avoid memory DoS?

          Graphviz
               Optional link map (outsource source to exter-
               nal link)?

          Cache
               Server-side cache (outsource?)

          Templates
               Some protocol options to turn  off  templates
               for  naked encoding (but not for gnuplot, for
               instance, that depends upon the  template  to
               return an image).

          Config
               Windows-style config files (or XML?).





                       6 February 2007





TODO                         -2-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


          Crontab
               Crontab to delete daily cruft (left over from
               over-ambitious users who outstrip  resources,
               causing files.

          Actions
               Plenary Classes

          Install
               Replace  ad-hoc  installations  by  copytree;
               fail on directory existence.

          1.1.1.  Multiple Documents

               Protocol
                    Protocol change: return a dictionary  of
                    {MIME: ARRAY} objects; where ARRAY is an
                    array of  matching  documents  (such  as
                    dvipng's image-per- page).

               Structure
                    Breadth-first  or  depth-first: meaning,
                    array  of  atomic  dictionaries;  or  an
                    array of unbound arrays?

                    Second may be slightly more efficient in
                    those  cases  where  one   source,   for
                    instance, wields multiple targets (e.g.,
                    latex to multiple PNGs); but more diffi-
                    cult  to  distinguish between uneven and
                    incomplete data.

                    First may require some redundance (e.g.,
                    redundant  MIDIs  per  LilyPond page, or
                    source per LaTeX image); but is cleaner,
                    and determinant.

                    The   superset  renderer  will  have  to
                    receive a glob of targets; but how  does
                    it distinguish between partitioned (e.g.
                    PNGs)  and  whole  (e.g.   LaTeX-source)
                    data?

                    And if partitioned data should come back
                    incomplete or in  disparate  quantities?
                    Can flag partitioned data, I suppose.

                    Bottom line: don't want to fuck up clean
                    design; but may relent to multipage out-
                    put   if   necessary.   (LilyPond's  eps
                    driver, for instance, outputs the  whole
                    document  in  one  page;  can link to an
                    optional pdf  if  multi-page  output  is
                    desirable.)



                       6 February 2007





TODO                         -3-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


                    General  solution: offer optional alter-
                    native download (PDF, say) for multipage
                    docs, specified as parameter.

     1.2.  Documentation

          Doxygen
               Real  doxygen;  what  to do about docstrings,
               though? Answer: wait until  docutils  matures
               into  automatic  reStructuredText extraction.
               (Doxygen  also  does  the  nice  call-graphs,
               though; and (who knows?) may do docstrings at
               some point.)

          TODO Raus; find something else: bugzilla?

          Permissions
               Work  with  MediaWiki   to   restrict   usage
               (optionally) to certain classes of users.

          XML-RPC-lib
               Add fallback-support for phpxmlrpc or Incutio
               for those  with  little  control  over  their
               installations,  willing to take a performance
               hit.

     1.3.  Handler

          Throttle
               A "check back in X seconds" message on  over-
               usage.

          Database
               Swap  out  home-brew  lock  system  for  some
               heavy-duty piece-of-shit (mysql,  say;  post-
               gre; or even sqlite3).

     1.4.  Jailkit

          Paths
               Dynamic  jailkit with gno-tools (./configure,
               etc.); throw  in  --with-user,  --with-group,
               etc.;  or:  make  a  build_jailkit  target in
               setup.py.

2.  Exacta

     Server-client dichotomy
          Server is now its own entity: mod_tex; the client,
          a MediaWiki client, is mod_tex.

     Packaging
          Combine both server and client into a common pack-
          age, or  utterly  segregated  (thus  possibly  not

          confusing the client-users)?

          Latter:  combined  source;  `src'  directory: con-
          tains: `client', `server'.

     PHP-client
          Basic request working; now to do something  useful
          with it.

     Temp-dir
          Does  cleanup happen after exceptions? (The object
          is deleted, after all.)

          Yes.

     Python Apache-handler
          Trader Joe acts as a  middle-man  between  locally
          running,  unprivileged,  chrooted  servers and the
          requesting public.

          More efficient? Possibly; will rebuke  the  prema-
          ture optimization for now.

     THANKS
          Get Erik in there. Hephaistos, Hermes Charmophron,
          Apollon, Hestia, Hera, Athena, dodeka Theoi.

     Footer/Header
          mod_tex <VERSION> in footers  or  headers,  across
          from date

     Honest work in subserver
          Invocation of latex, dvipng

     Web install
          Installs into web-root and changes ownership.

     Title page
          ms-macro  to  institute  title  page (include with
          .so)

     License
          Includable ms-file for license (.so)

     2.1.  Generic

          2.1.1.  Cache

               Purview
                    Client-, server-side or both?

               Failure
                    Problem: in 1.0+, failed rendering don't
                    get cached and are rerendered every day.



                       6 February 2007





TODO                         -5-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


                    Distinguish, therefore, between  server-
                    and  syntax-failures;  and cache accord-
                    ingly.

                    No: a simple flag  PHP  side  will  turn
                    on/off  error  caching; functioning sys-
                    tems can turn it  off  for  performance,
                    and for debugging purposes: back on.

                    It  may be useful to distinguish between
                    temporary and permanent errors, now that
                    we have ad-hoc classes.

     2.2.  Server

          Debug
               Add  a verbosity option on some facilities to
               be invoked when modtex-debug is invoked;  and
               quiet, otherwise.

          Config
               Simplified on excision of client.

          Resource Limits
               Don't setrlimits in case of debug.

          Facilities
               Facility constructor takes merely a **kwargs,
               and populates accordingly; no  pre-set  vars.
               (Implemented: pre-set args and **kwargs.)

          Debug
               build_scripts command which takes --debug and
               disables optimization in modtex-main.py

               No: rather a modtex/main.py, and two  trivial
               wrappers: modtex and modtex- debug, which are
               invoked with `python -O' and `python' respec-
               tively.

          IP-throttle
               Database of author vs. time

          setrlimit
               Per-request (post droppriv)

          MIME-types
               Currently  a  non-descript list in Constants;
               instantiate MIME-wrappers  with  well-defined
               instance variables.

          Delivery
               Client-server  contract  for  the delivery of
               content (keys for XMLRPC response); encode in

TODO                         -6-            mod_tex 0.1-beta


               a format parseable by PHP: XML, say?

               Right now: using an implicit contract (image:
               content).  A low-tech published API may  suf-
               fice.

     2.3.  Client

          Source
               `errors' directory to house the manifold.

          Authentication
               CURL-lib  on  PHP  can  handle basic and key-
               based.

          Errors
               Unified error presentation.

          Documentation
               Own  PHP-client  documentation,  or  combined
               with server's (current).

          2.3.1.  Cache

               Purview
                    Use  MediaWiki  mechanism with its over-
                    head, or some ad-hoc system?

               MediaWiki
                    MediaWiki mechanism: must be tweaked  to
                    forbid  arbitrary upload; but can detect
                    orphaned files: Special:Unusedimages.

                    Must forge, apparently,  a  subclass  of
                    WebRequest,  filling  in artificial val-
                    ues.

               Home-brew
                    Own mechanism: lightweight; but  respon-
                    sibility (cruft).

     2.4.  Documentation

          Territory
               Copyright notices, etc.

          README Mon Jan 22 08:36:11 PST 2007
               Installation

          Build Sun Jan 21 01:46:55 PST 2007
               Build  target  in  Setup.py which invokes the
               Makefile in doc.
